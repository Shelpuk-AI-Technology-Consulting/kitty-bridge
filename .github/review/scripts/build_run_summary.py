"""Render the job summary shown at the top of the workflow run page.

A failed attempt leaves annotations behind that say nothing about whether the
run mattered. ``claude-code-action`` writes two ``::error::`` lines and the
runner adds a third for the non-zero exit, and ``continue-on-error`` suppresses
none of them.

Left unexplained, a run page that opens with red crosses teaches people to
ignore this workflow, which is worse than the workflow not existing.

With one provider and a failed review failing the job, the case to guard
against is a red run whose annotations do not distinguish "the provider was out
of quota" from "the workflow is broken" -- two outcomes fixed by different
people.

The summary below is written to ``$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY``, which GitHub renders
above the step list, so the first thing a reader sees says what actually
happened and what to do about it.
