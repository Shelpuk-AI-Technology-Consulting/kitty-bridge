# CI preflight: prove the capabilities a job invokes are present, BEFORE it uses them.
#
# Adopted verbatim from an internal repository where it is in production. Only this header
# differs, and it differs because two of the sentences it used to carry are NOT true
# here -- see the guard note below. Everything from `set -uo pipefail` down is
# byte-identical on purpose, so a fix made upstream can be carried across by copying
# the body.
#
# Nothing in a runner label tells you which TOOLS the machine carries, and this is
# what checks that at run time, before the step that needs them.
#
# 🔴 Why this matters more than its size suggests. Upstream measured `unzip` present
# on one runner and absent on another one day apart, across a heterogeneous
# self-hosted fleet. A missing tool therefore does not fail a job -- it fails it only
# when placement is unlucky, and the re-run passes. That is the most expensive failure
# class a shared fleet has: one upstream incident cost five days of undeployable
# frontends before anyone identified a missing Docker daemon as the cause.
#
# ⚠️ **That measurement is INHERITED and describes a fleet this repository does not
# use.** This repository's workflows run on a GitHub-hosted runner, which is uniform
# per label rather than heterogeneous -- so the "unlucky placement" shape does not
# apply here.
#
# 🔴 **The SLIM-IMAGE argument that stood here is FALSIFIED, and is corrected rather
# than deleted.** It read that the risk kept this script alive because a slim image is
# precisely a claim to carry fewer packages, and `unzip` is what gets trimmed. That was
# true while `claude-code-review.yml` ran on `ubuntu-slim`. It no longer does -- that
# job is this script's only caller, and it moved to `ubuntu-latest`, which carries
# `unzip`. Leaving the sentence would have left this file asserting the opposite of the
# workflow that calls it, one file apart, which is the partial-fix shape this
# repository keeps having to remove.
#
# 🔴 **The reason that survives is the one that never depended on the image.** `unzip`
# is shelled out to by `anthropics/claude-code-action`, two levels down, and is named
# NOWHERE in this repository -- so no scan of `run:` blocks can find it, and only
# probing for the capabilities a job's ACTIONS need will. That argument held on the
# self-hosted fleet, held on `ubuntu-slim`, and holds now. The script is a no-op on a
# runner that already carries the package, which is the point: it costs nothing when it
# is not needed and names the package when it is.
#
# ⚠️ On a GitHub-hosted runner this should SELF-HEAL rather than fail: the job has
# passwordless sudo, so a missing package is installed and a warning emitted. Read
# that warning as a finding about the image -- it costs every run the download.
#
# 🔴 **THE OTHER HALF OF THE UPSTREAM GUARANTEE IS ABSENT HERE, AND THAT IS THE THING
# TO KNOW.** Upstream pairs this with two `lint`-job guards -- one proving a job asks
# for a runner label that exists, and one proving every job that needs a capability
# actually calls this script. This repository has neither, so `claude-code-review.yml`
# calling this is a CONVENTION rather than an enforced invariant: a future job that
# needs `unzip` and forgets the call fails the way this script exists to prevent, and
# nothing goes red to say so.
#
# ⚠️ `test_the_review_job_names_a_known_runner_as_a_literal` covers a slice of the
# first guard -- it refuses a label outside a written-down set -- but it cannot tell
# whether that label is actually OFFERED to this repository, which is the half that
# queues for ever in silence. Port the real guards the day a third workflow lands.
#
# ⚠️ **Shell, not Python, and that is a claim about this script's LANGUAGE, not its
# position.** A job may need a capability BEFORE it provisions an interpreter -- and
# reaching for the system interpreter is not an option: it has no pip, and a stale
# broken tool-cache interpreter can precede `setup-python`'s on `PATH`. A Python
# preflight could therefore only run after provisioning, which is after several of the
# steps it exists to protect.
#
# ⚠️ **Where this step goes is a separate rule: before the first step that USES the
# capability.** In `claude-code-review.yml` that is before `anthropics/claude-code-action`,
# which is what shells out to `unzip`.
#
# Usage:
#     .github/review/scripts/ci_preflight.sh docker
#     .github/review/scripts/ci_preflight.sh jq unzip
#     .github/review/scripts/ci_preflight.sh --self-test
#
# Exits 0 when every named capability is usable from the calling step, 1 otherwise.

# 🔴 `docker info`, never `command -v docker`. upstream was a missing DAEMON, and a client with
# no reachable daemon passes a `command -v` and then dies at the first build -- the exact
# symptom-shaped failure this exists to convert into a named one. `info` talks to the daemon;
# `--version` does not.
#
# ⚠️ Capabilities that CANNOT be installed by a job carry an empty package on purpose. Docker
# is a daemon, a socket and a group membership on a shared machine; a step that pretended to
# install it would appear to self-heal and would not. It fails, naming the runner.
#
# The pattern for the installable ones is `claude-code-review.yml`'s, which README.md calls
# "the pattern worth copying": probe, install if the box allows it, otherwise fail naming the
# package rather than 20 lines into a third-party action's log.
