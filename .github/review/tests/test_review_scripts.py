"""Tests for the pull request review workflow scripts.

These scripts decide whether a review happens at all, which provider serves it,
and what lands on the pull request, so a silent break here disables review
across the repository without anything going red.

Written as ``unittest.TestCase`` classes so they run under both
``python -m unittest`` and ``pytest``. They must stay runnable with nothing but a
Python interpreter and no installed dependencies: a broken review workflow has to
be diagnosable without first provisioning an environment, and the components'
own venvs are not on the path here.

Run from the repository root:

    python .github/review/tests/test_review_scripts.py

``unittest discover`` cannot be used here: it imports the start directory as a
package, and ``.github`` is not a valid package name, so the file is executed
directly instead.

Every provider error string below is copied verbatim from a real workflow run,
not invented. Guessed error vocabulary is exactly what caused the classifier to
misread an exhausted quota as a transient rate limit.

#: Platform job ceiling, in minutes, for every runner label this repository is
#: prepared to name. **These are GitHub's numbers, not this repository's**, which
#: is why they sit in one table with a source rather than beside each job.
#:
#: 🔴 `ubuntu-slim` is a SINGLE-CPU runner, and GitHub's runner reference states
#: the constraint in one sentence: *"The job timeout for single-CPU runners is 15
#: minutes. If a job reaches this limit, the job is terminated and fails."* It is
#: a property of the platform and **cannot be overridden from configuration**, so
#: a `timeout-minutes:` above it is not a longer budget -- it is a fiction that
#: nothing reports until a job is killed mid-run.
#:
#: 🔴 **That is not hypothetical; it is why this table exists.** The review job
#: declared `timeout-minutes: 60` on `ubuntu-slim`. Five attempts were killed at
#: 15m0s over three days on five different pull requests -- job ids 99916228958,
#: 100274991357, 100287032371, 100714288570 and 100725754347 -- each annotated
#: *"The job has exceeded the maximum execution time of 15m0s"*, on a
#: merge-gating check, while every offline check in this file stayed green.
#: Nothing anywhere paired the two lines, and
#: `test_the_review_has_no_step_cap_and_a_job_cap_that_clears_the_measurement`
#: actively required a cap the named runner could never honour.
#:
#: 360 is the ordinary GitHub-hosted ceiling (6 hours). 7200 is the self-hosted
#: one (5 days); the self-hosted labels are kept so a move back does not have to
#: fight this table, exactly as `KNOWN_RUNNERS` kept them.

    """🔴 THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC. THE ONE THIS SYSTEM CAME FROM IS NOT.

    This review system was carried across from a private repository, comment for
    comment, because the reasoning in those comments is most of its value. That
    is also how a private repository's name, its sibling repositories and its
    ticket namespaces get published: not by anybody deciding to, but by a
    verbatim copy nobody re-read, or by the next fix carried across the same way.

    ⚠️ **A review cannot be relied on to catch it.** The tokens are unremarkable
    in isolation -- a ticket key in a comment reads as ordinary provenance -- and
    they arrive in diffs that are hundreds of lines of prose. The first pass at
    this port carried over two hundred of them.

    🔴 **THE RULES MATCH A SHAPE, NEVER A NAME, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.**
    The obvious guard is a denylist of the private repository's name, its
    siblings and its ticket prefixes -- and it is wrong twice over:

    * **It publishes exactly what it forbids.** The pattern and its own test
      fixtures would have to spell out every private name, in a tracked file, in
      a public repository. The guard would become the leak.
    * **It only ever finds what somebody already remembered.** Written as a
      denylist first, this guard listed one ticket prefix and passed; rewritten
      to match the shape, it immediately found a SECOND prefix, from a different
      private project, in three files nobody had looked at.

    ⚠️ **What this does NOT cover, said plainly so a green run is not
    over-read:** runner hostnames, internal URLs, and personal names have no
    shape a regex can separate from legitimate text. Those were removed by hand
    and nothing here will notice them coming back.

    🔴 **Nor does it catch a BARE issue-key prefix** -- `ABC-` with no number.
    That is not hypothetical: exactly one slipped through into `.requirements/`
    and was found by hand, not here. The ticket rule requires digits because
    dropping that requirement matches `UTF-`, `SHA-`, and every hyphenated
    capital in ordinary prose, which would make the guard unusable. The trade is
    deliberate and this is the note that records it. **If you are carrying a
    comment across, read it.**

    🔴 **Nor does the slug rule see a slug SPLIT ACROSS A LINE**, and there are
    two live instances of that shape in this tree -- `model_context_sync.py` and
    its own test both build a raw-content URL by concatenating two Python string
    literals, with the break falling between the owner and the repository name.
    Neither is a leak, both name this repository, and the rule reports neither.
    The claim sweep one class over solved the same problem by joining each line
    to its successor; that is not done here because this rule runs over every
    tracked file rather than one directory, and a join doubles the work of the
    widest sweep in this module for a shape that has produced no leak yet.
    **The gap is recorded rather than closed, and the next URL carried across is
    where it bites.**

        — the guard reads only the `|| 'literal'` fallback — so that one line was the
        single place the runner policy could move without any check noticing.

        🔴 **The second thing it forbids is a label nothing offers**, which is a
        different failure and a quieter one. Measured on this repository: three jobs
        asking for a self-hosted capability sat `queued` for over fifteen minutes with
        no error, no annotation and no timeout, while a GitHub-hosted job on the same
        pull request finished in 55 seconds. A typo in a label is indistinguishable
        from a runner nobody granted, and neither says anything at all.

        ⚠️ **What this test CANNOT check, said plainly so a green run is not
        over-read:** whether the label it accepts is actually offered to this
        repository. This test proves the label is one somebody wrote down on purpose —
        never that a machine will answer.

        🔴 **An earlier version of this paragraph gave the wrong reason**, and the
        wrong reason is what cost the time. It said `ubuntu-slim` was configured by
        the organisation, so its availability was a property of the org and invisible
        from here. It is a standard GitHub-hosted public label, listed in the same
        table as `ubuntu-latest`. The caveat above survives the correction — no
        offline check can promise a runner answers — but the *reason* was an invented
        one, and it sent a documented 15-minute platform ceiling to be hunted for in
        organisation settings. What separates these labels is their job ceiling, which
        `DeclaredJobCapIsEnforceableTests` now checks against the cap each job
        declares.

        ⚠️ Matched with a regex rather than parsed, deliberately: this suite runs on a
        bare interpreter with **no dependency install**, so importing PyYAML here would

        **This replaces three tests that asserted a step-level cap** — that one existed,
        that it sat below the job cap, and that it cleared a measured runtime. upstream
        deleted the step cap, so all three described a shape that no longer exists.

        Why it was deleted rather than raised: the two caps sat two minutes apart, and
        the review died at **20m12s** against the 20-minute step cap, leaving the job
        1m48s to classify the failure, comment and write the summary. A second ceiling
        just under the first does not protect those steps — it starves them.

        The number is a measurement, not a tier: `a sibling repository` runs this same
        action, model, `--effort max` and `--max-turns 150`, and across **52 successful
        runs** its median is 455s and its **maximum 1244s — 20.7 minutes**. Any job cap
        at or below 21 kills that tail.

        🔴 **THIS repository's own distribution, added BESIDE the inherited one rather
        than replacing it** -- two measurements from two repositories are two labelled
        facts, and a recorded measurement is never edited to keep a document tidy.
        Measured per ATTEMPT, since a re-run adds an attempt to the same run id and a
        per-run reading undercounts: across **49 successful attempts**, median 543s,
        p90 818s, **maximum success 868s -- 14m28s**.

        ⚠️ **And here is why that second measurement had to be taken: every figure
        above was compared against a cap the runner never honoured.** This job ran on
        `ubuntu-slim`, whose platform ceiling is 15 minutes and cannot be raised from
        configuration, so "a job cap that clears the measurement" was a true statement
        about a number nothing read. Five attempts were killed at 15m0s. The job moved
        to `ubuntu-latest`.

        This repository's reviewer configuration is the three `KITTY_*`
        settings and `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL`. The upstream workflow this was
        adopted from used `DEEPSEEK_*`, and a `${{ secrets.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY }}`
        left behind by the port would resolve to an empty string, report
        `available=false`, and resolve as fatal on every run.

        Comments naming DeepSeek are fine and expected -- it is the model behind
        `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL`. An *expression* reading a `DEEPSEEK_` secret or
        variable is not.

        🔴 **upstream added the three retired names to this pattern**, which is
        the same failure with a shorter fuse: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
        `ANTHROPIC_ENDPOINT` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` were *deleted* from the
        repository when the reviewer moved to OpenRouter, so a leftover
        reference resolves to `""` exactly as a `DEEPSEEK_` one would -- and
        unlike a rename that never happened, these three were live last week
        and are what a revert or a stale branch reintroduces.

        🔴 **upstream retires `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with `configure_provider.py`
        itself.** Kitty Bridge reads its endpoint from `profiles.json`, so the
        repository variable has nothing left to configure. The name survives at
        runtime -- as kitty's own child-env write, pointing the CLI at the local
        bridge -- which is exactly why a leftover
        `${{ vars.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL }}` would resolve to `""` while looking
        busier than the other three ever did.

        🔴 **upstream also retires `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` -- after it failed
        live, exactly the way this guard predicts.** The operator deleted the
        secret when adding the `KITTY_*` settings, while the workflow still
        bound the action's `anthropic_api_key` input to it; the input resolved
        to `""`, the action's startup gate threw, and the review job reported
        `fatal -- no execution record` with a diagnostic listing settings that
        were all correct. The launch input now rides on
        `secrets.KITTY_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (kitty overrides `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
        in the child, so the gate value never reaches the provider), and this
        pattern stops a revert or a stale branch from reintroducing the dead
        reference silently.

        `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` on the grounds that it would "compete" with the
        value written to `$GITHUB_ENV`. That premise was wrong.** GitHub
        configuration variables are exposed only through the `vars` context and
        secrets only through `secrets`; neither is injected into the runner's
        environment. A repository variable cannot shadow anything by existing,
        so the old guard pinned a name while the hazard walked past it.

        The hazard is one step further on: a value bound into an `env:` key
        under a CLI name *does* reach the CLI, and does so **without passing
        through kitty** -- the only writer left. Kitty maps the CLI's endpoint,
        credential and all three model tiers onto the local bridge and onto the
        profile's model; a step-level binding overrides the child environment
        kitty builds, so the request goes somewhere kitty never configured
        while every diagnostic reports the profile's values. Bypassing it works
        well enough to look correct, and the next edit deletes the step as
        redundant.

        **The invariant is one writer, so the value bound does not matter.** A
        hard-coded literal is flagged too: a step-level `env:` wins over the
        child environment kitty builds, so it silently overrides the configured
        value while the run summary goes on reporting the profile's.
        OpenRouter's example workflow hard-codes the endpoint exactly this way,
        which makes it the likeliest copy-paste rather than a hypothetical.

          docs.github.com/rest/issues/comments (2026-07-31): list and get take

        respected here rather than reverted inside a merge — this test pins
        whatever is declared, so it protects the current set either way, and
        dropping the grant later is a one-line change with this as the net.

# repository's own pull requests, the reviewer was shown 24 of 62 contributions
# on #213 and 20 of 62 on #208, and re-raised a finding whose published answer
# had scrolled out of the excerpt. The other -- a reply parked in a PENDING
# review, visible only to its author -- has never happened here, and the reason
# is the reply convention rather than luck: 404 threads across 20 pull requests,

    exist -- which is exactly how a sentence telling the reviewer to read one
    gets written and never noticed. On the runner the model then spends turns
    looking for a file that is not there and, worse, reports what it could not
    find as absent rather than as unreadable.

    ⚠️ **Asserted positively, by resolving paths, rather than by matching
    phrasings.** Upstream's equivalent guard matches the shape of a retired
    *claim*; that approach is right for a belief and wrong for this, because the
    set of ways to say "read the design document" is unbounded while the set of
    always-read paths is three lines long. This resolves each of them against the
    tree and against `.gitignore`, so a new always-read document is checked the
    moment it is named.

    ⚠️ **That day came: the test-suite design landed in
    `.system_design/TEST_SUITE.md` and `/.system_design/` left `.gitignore`.**
    This class changed accordingly --
    `.system_design` is no longer one of the excluded prefixes, so the pattern no
    longer forbids sending the reviewer there, and a sentence doing so is now a
    specimen in the ALLOWED list rather than the FORBIDDEN one. The control keeps
    `.requirements`, which is still excluded; it was not given a replacement
    second path, because a control built on a path that is not excluded asserts
    nothing while still looking like a control.

    The class also now asserts `.system_design` is **absent** from the excluded
    set, so the day it is re-excluded this fails and says to restore it, rather
    than silently permitting a promise the checkout cannot keep.

    🔴 **Both of those are now CLOSED, and this is the record.** The rules were
    imported: `CLAIMS` carries one forbidding the claim that the repository
    holds no such document and one forbidding the claim that the directory is
    excluded, anchored verb-first so the sweep's line-join cannot manufacture a
    match. The prompt, the guide, the setup README and the `docs` and
    `packaging` rule files were corrected to say the documents are tracked and
    to name them as the internal specification, `README.md` being the
    user-facing one.

    ⚠️ **What holds the correction is a POSITIVE check, not this sweep.** A
    sweep proves a sentence is gone and can never prove one is there, and the
    defect here was an absence -- see
    :class:`ReviewerIsPointedAtTheDesignDocumentsTests`, which asserts each
    instruction is present.

    ⚠️ **This class's own sweep was two files short and now walks the rules
    directory** (:meth:`_documents`). `rules/docs.md` and `rules/packaging.md`
    both instruct the reviewer and both sat outside the guard that forbids
    promising a path the checkout lacks.

    range in `kitty-bridge`, and that is sound there: it is an observation about
    a third-party dependency, pinned to a version.

    **Here the same citation is a cross-reference into this repository's own

    lines -- a reviewer is told the workflow's claim is checkable, follows the
    citation, and lands somewhere unrelated. Meanwhile the workflow keeps

    the code that runs.

    allowlist". Only the ``curl`` half is. ``Read`` and ``Bash(cat:*)`` are
    allowlisted over **any** path, and ``configure_kitty.py`` writes the
    organisation's provider keys to ``~/.config/kitty/credentials.json`` and the
    gateway to ``egress.json`` on the same machine.

    So reading a secret is possible. What decides whether it is *published* is
    the set of channels leaving the runner, and the review has exactly two: the
    uploaded artifact, and the review body the model writes.

    🔴 **The artifact was the automatic one.** ``extract_schema_errors.py``
    copies the entire stream-json execution record -- everything the model read,
    verbatim -- and it was written into ``artifacts/``, which every run uploads
    on ``always()``. No injection was needed for the *upload*; only for the read.
    The record now goes to ``RUNNER_TEMP``, exactly as the kitty debug log
    already does: the machine is destroyed with the job, and only bounded,
    redacted evidence travels.

    ⚠️ **The second channel is not closed by this and cannot be closed here.** A
